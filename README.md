## How to use

- Sample codes exists [here](samples/sample.py)<br>
    ``` sample.py
    import sys
    import re
    import StreamChatAgent as sca  # Import this.

    # callback for getting YouTube chat item
    # You can implement several processes in it.
    # This example prints datetime, ahthor name, message, of each item.
    def get_item_cb(c):
      print(f"{c.datetime} [{c.author.name}]- {c.message}")

    # pre putting queue filter
    # You can edit YouTube chat item before putting internal queue.
    # You can avoid putting internal queue by returning None.
    # This example removes item whose message consists of stamps only.
    def pre_filter_cb(c):
      return None if re.match(r'^(:[^:]+:)+$', c.message) else c

    # post getting queue filter
    # You can edit YouTube chat item after popping internal queue.
    # You can avoid sending item to get_item_cb by returning None.
    # This example removes stamps from message of item.
    def post_filter_cb(c):
      c.message = re.sub(r':[^:]+:','', c.message)
      return c

    # Video ID is given from command line in this example.
    if len(sys.argv) <= 1:
      exit(0)

    # Create StreamChatAgent instance.
    params = sca.params(
      video_id = sys.argv[1],
      get_item_cb = get_item_cb,
      pre_filter_cb = pre_filter_cb,
      post_filter_cb = post_filter_cb
    )
    agent = sca.StreamChatAgent( params )

    # Start async getting YouTube chat items.
    # Then get_item_cb is called continuosly.
    agent.start()

    # Wait any key inputted from keyboad.
    input()

    # Finish getting items.
    # Internal thread will stop soon.
    agent.disconnect()

    # Wait terminating internal threads.
    agent.join()

    del agent
    ```

## Methods
### start()
- Start polling and calling user callbacks asyncronously.
- No arguments required, nothing returns.

### join()
- Wait terminating internal threads kicked by start().
- No arguments required, nothing returns.

### connect()

- Lines following the call of the method never executen before terminate of internal threads.
- No arguments required, nothing returns.

## Callbacks
### get_item_cb

- It's not be assumed that any values are returned.
### pre_filter_cb
- pre putting queue filter.
- YouTube chat item is thrown as an argument.
- You can edit YouTube chat items before putting internal queue.

## Type of YouTube Chat item
- Please refer [pytchat README](https://github.com/taizan-hokuto/pytchat)

## Concept of design
- Putting thread is separated from getting thread in order to avoid locking polling.<br>
Unexpected sleep of pytchat may reduce by ths approach.
- If internal queue is full when putting thread try to push new item, oldest item is removed from the queue before pushing.
